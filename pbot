# PBot was started around 2001, 2002. It has been lovingly maintained;
# however, it does use the ancient Net::IRC package and some outdated
# Perl5 practices.
#
# It would be nice to use modern packages like Moo
# and Mojo::IRC, but PBot is a labor of 20+ years of love and contains
# many significant features that depend on how Net::IRC and Perl5 behaves.
#
# But don't fear. PBot's forked Net::IRC package has also been maintained
# and updated along with PBot. It contains numerous bugfixes and supports
# various new features such as IRCv3 user capability negotiation and SASL
# authentication.
