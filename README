* List of Perl module dependencies, for installation.
* Description of each PBot module, for customisation.

The first thing you'll want to do is edit pbot.pl and change the default

  * If you did not extract/checkout PBot into ~/pbot (where ~/pbot/PBot 
contains the PBot.pm module), you'll want to change $pbothome in pbot.pl 
to point to the directory that contains the PBot, config, data, etc directories.

  * Change the IRC settings in pbot.pl so that the bot-nick and identify password are
associated with a registered NickServ account, if you want channel auto-join to succeed.

More information coming soon.  Work in progress.
