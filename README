* List of Perl module dependencies, for installation.
* Description of each PBot module, for customisation.

The first thing you'll want to do is edit pbot.pl and change the default
settings: 

  * If you did not extract/checkout PBot into ~/pbot (where ~/pbot/PBot 
contains the PBot.pm module), you'll want to change $pbothome in pbot.pl 
to point to the directory that contains the PBot, config, data, etc directories.

  * Change the IRC settings in pbot.pl so that the bot-nick and identify password are
associated with a registered NickServ account, if you want channel auto-join to succeed.

More information coming soon.  Work in progress.

/lib/perl5/site-perl/Net/IRC/Connection.pm around line 405 has a sub DESTROY where I inserted a return; in the first line,
otherwise it would disconnect from IRC after a module exits:

05:53:16 < pragma_>     404 # Standard destructor method for the GC routines. (HAHAHAH! DIE! DIE! DIE!)
05:53:17 < pragma_>     405 sub DESTROY {
05:53:17 < pragma_>     406   my $self = shift;
05:53:17 < pragma_>     407   return;  # <--- added to prevent disconnecting after forking exits
05:53:17 < pragma_>     408   $self->handler("destroy", "nobody will ever use this");
05:53:17 < pragma_>     409   $self->quit();
05:53:17 < pragma_>     410   # anything else?
05:53:17 < pragma_>     411 }

Todo:

Add SSL and port options.

04:33:09 < pragma_> you can type in the bot's stdin to talk in channels as the bot
04:33:39 < candide> hi
04:33:50 < pragma_> that was typing 'msg #pbot2 hi'
04:34:15 < pragma_> you can send bot commands to channel by using ~channel command
04:34:56 < pragma_> no, it was ~channel command
04:35:11 < pragma_> like ~channel kick <args>
04:35:18 < pragma_> because kick has to be used in a channel
04:35:29 < pragma_> I'll have to document that
04:36:09 < pragma_> that's from stdin only though
04:36:20 < pragma_> and you can still background it with ^Z
