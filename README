More information coming soon.  Work in progress.

PBot requires Perl 5.10, especially for !cc 
--------------------------
PBot is intended for the Freenode IRC network.  As such, it has not been
tested on other networks.  Some IRC features, such as NickServ auto-join, may need adjusting.
--------------------------
The first thing you'll want to do is edit pbot.pl and change the default
settings: 

  * If you did not extract/checkout PBot into ~/pbot (where ~/pbot/PBot 
contains the PBot.pm module), you'll want to change $pbothome in pbot.pl 
to point to the directory that contains the PBot, config, data, etc directories.

  * Change the IRC settings in pbot.pl so that the bot-nick and identify password are
associated with a registered NickServ account, if you want channel auto-join to succeed.
--------------------------
Then you'll need to get several modules from CPAN.  If you do not have root access, see

--------------------------
Some quick-and-dirty info on using stdin (pbot shell after running pbot.sh):

< pragma_> you can type in the bot's stdin to talk in channels as the bot
< candide> hi
< pragma_> that was typing 'msg #pbot2 hi' from the bot's stdin
< pragma_> you can send bot commands to channel by using ~channel command
< pragma_> like ~channel kick <args>
< pragma_> because kick has to be used in a channel
< pragma_> and you can still background the bot with ^Z
--------------------------
Coming soon to README:

* Description of each PBot module, for customisation.
--------------------------
Todo:

* Add SSL and port options to pbot.pl.
